#Frogger Clone

This is a project forked from Udacity's Front End Nanodegree (_FEND_ for short). It's a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger built on HTML5's canvas using Javascript as the engine language.

==============================

##How to Play##

Either clone the project to your desktop and open the index.html file *or* go to [here.](https://timjkstrickland.github.io/froggerclone/)

Use the directional keys to move around the map. Avoid the bugs at all costs (much like every developer should). If you get hit by the bugs, you *lose*!

###Scoring###

Get to the water to get 100 points. See what your high score can be!

##Future Goals for this Project##
### Short-term Goals###
With more time, I would create a function to add collectibles to increase score limit. Another function would be to manipulate the bugs in some way, either to freeze them or destroy all bugs on the screen. 

###Long-term Goals###
With *A LOT* more time, I'd build a level to incorporate the key icon and a warping mechanism so that the level is much larger and plays out with scrolling functionality. The bugs would come from every direction and would be generated randomly to appear from every direction at any speed.
